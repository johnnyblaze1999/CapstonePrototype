# CapstonePrototype
Early attempts to figure out the best approach for this AI chatbot project

OpenAI API: An approach to obtain an existing GPT 3.5 for an AI chatbot. It didn't work because of the cost per token, and the bot doesn't have any knowledge base.
OpenAI fine-tune: An approach to add a knowledge base to OpenAI GPT 3.5 by sending a preset text before every request. This method is insufficient because of the high delay and high cost.
Train AI on existing dataset: An approach to creating a bot from scratch, and using the dataset as an answer sheet. This method is not working because it requires a lot of time to train and modify the bot.

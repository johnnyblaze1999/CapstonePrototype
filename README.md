# CapstonePrototype
Early attempts to figure out the best approach for this AI chatbot project

OpenAI API: An approach to obtain an existing GPT 3.5 for an AI chatbot. It didn't work because of the cost per token, and the bot doesn't have any knowledge base.

OpenAI fine-tune: An approach to add a knowledge base to OpenAI GPT 3.5 by sending a preset text before every request. This method is insufficient because of the high delay and high cost.

Train AI on existing dataset: An approach to creating a bot from scratch, and using the dataset as an answer sheet. This method is not working because it requires a lot of time to train and modify the bot.

BotPress Chatbot: The current state of the project with a working chatbot. It also includes a simple knowledge base file that is uploaded to BotPress Chatbot.

To run the chatbot, Copy the URL in Chatbot.url inside the BotPress Chabot folder. You can also paste this URL directly:

# Note: The API token is depleted, and the AI is no longer accepting any request.

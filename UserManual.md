# User Manual for Chatbot

To start a conversation, the user needs to initiate first in the conversation.

The user's inputs will be invalid until they reach an option that allows them to freely ask questions.

Follow instructions from the Chatbot to proceed to the next state of conversation.

Thank you for using our chatbot!
